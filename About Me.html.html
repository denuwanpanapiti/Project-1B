        <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

        <p>I possess skills in drawing and painting through a wide range of art styles that I developed during high school where I studied Visual Arts as an elective.I also have skills in working with Adobe softwares such as After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Premiere and I’ve been applying all my drawing skills and adapting them to these online softwares so that I can use these skills in the real world whether I’m working for a business or entering into the art world.</p>

        <h2 id="traits">Traits</h2>

        <p>I’m a person who is ambitious and passionate about what they love and what they do. I’ve always wanted to enter any sort of field in graphic design not only because of the work in which you do but also what you can gain out of working as a graphic designer. I’m an optimistic learner who is willing to learn new skills and possess any creative ideas that I have. On top of that I am someone who is willing to push boundaries and come up with unique ideas instead of following certain trends or being stuck in the same mold.</p>

        <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
        <p>My other hobbies and interests include basketball, cricket and music. When I was young, I used to play basketball and cricket competitively every Friday and Saturday and I did well in both. I don’t play competitively anymore but I like playing both these sports with friends and family for fun. I also developed a love for music when I was young being able to play piano and drums. Music is probably my other passion alongside graphic design.</p>
